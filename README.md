# Open Data Discovery Specification (ODD Spec): A Universal Standard for Metadata Collection 

 

## Specification

* :point_right:  [`specification.md`](./specification/specification.md) is a versioned description of the current OpenDataDiscovery standard. 
* :point_right:  Here is a reference implementation of Open Data Discovery Specification: [Open Data Platform](https://github.com/opendatadiscovery/odd-platform) (ODD Platform).

## Overview

ODD Spec is an open source industry-wide standard for collecting metadata. It provides a set of technologies to gather and export metadata from cloud-native applications, infrastructure, and other data sourcces to let it be discovered. The standard defines a schema for metadata collection and integrates with data tools through endpoints to receive metadata from them. 

Data catalogs built on ODD Spec would enjoy important opportunities like data federation, real end-to-end lineage, data quality assurance, company-wide observability, and discoverable ML assets.
